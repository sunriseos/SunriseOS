Unlike IRQ pins of the 8259A, the notion of interrupt priority is completely unrelated to the position of the physical interrupt input signal on the APIC. Instead, software determines the vector (and therefore the priority) for each corresponding interrupt input signal. For each interrupt signal, the operating system can also specify the signal polarity (low active or high active), whether the interrupt is signaled as edges or levels, as well as the destination and delivery mode of the interrupt. The information in the redirection table is used to translate the corresponding interrupt pin information into an inter-APIC message."]]});
