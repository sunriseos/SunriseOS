//! Programmable Interval Timer
//!
//! ### channels
//!
//! There are 3 channels :
//! * channel 0, wired to irq0.
//!   We use this one in rate generator mode, to keep track of the time
//!
//! * channel 1, "unusable, and may not even exist" ... whoah
//!
//! * channel 2, wired to pc speaker.
//!   We use this one in "one shot" mode to implement a simple wait function.
//!   Output is ANDed with a gate controlled by port 0x61 bit #1 before going to the pc speaker,
//!   we use this to enable/disable the speaker.
//    TODO
//!   However the channel can only track one countdown at a time,
//!   so we have to switch to channel 0 timers when we want to wait
//!   as soon as we have interruptions working
//!
//! ### operating modes
//!
//! Each channel can operate in different modes. The ones we use are:
//! * Mode 0 - Countdown (poorly named "Interrupt on Terminal Count").
//!   Used on channel 2 to create countdowns.
//!   Set the reset value, countdowns starts.
//!   When countdown goes to 0, OUT goes HIGH, and stays high.
//!
//! * Mode 2 - Rate generator.
//!   Used on channel 0 to create recurring irqs.
//!   Set the reset value. Countdown starts.
//!   When countdown goes to 0, OUT goes LOW for 1 clock cycle, and HIGH again,
//!   and countdown restarts.
//!
//! ### commands
//!
//! Pit commands are sent on port 0x43.
//! See [OSDEV](https://wiki.osdev.org/Programmable_Interval_Timer#I.2FO_Ports)
//!
//! To write channel reload values we always use the Access mode "lobyte/hibyte"
//!
//! ### port 0x61
//!
//! The PIT makes great use of the IO port 0x61 :
//! * bit #0 is channel 2 GATE control
//! * bit #1 is SPKR control
//! * bit #4 is channel 1 OUT status
//! * bit #5 is channel 2 OUT status
//!
