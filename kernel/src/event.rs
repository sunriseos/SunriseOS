//! The core event handling primitives of Sunrise.
//!
//! The Sunrise kernel supports a couple sources of events, such as IRQs, timers,
//! userspace-triggered events, and other. It must be possible to await for
//! one or multiple events at the same time.
//!
//! In order to do this, we have the Event trait. It works by (in theory)
//! registering an interest in an event, and putting the current process to
//! sleep (deregistering it from the scheduler). When the event is triggered,
//! the scheduler will wake the process up, allowing it work.

/// A waitable item.
///
/// There are essentially two kinds of Waitables: user-signaled and IRQ-backed.
/// IRQ-backed waitables are implemented by [IRQEvent], while user-signaled
/// events are implemented by [ReadableEvent].
///
/// It is possible that a raw waitable is not flexible enough though. For
/// instance, if we want to wait for 1 second, it might be necessary to wait on
/// the timer event multiple times. To do this, it is possible to implement our
/// own Waitable, that defers register to the underlying IRQEvent, but adds
/// additional logic to is_signaled. For example:
///
/// ```
/// use sunrise_kernel::event::{IRQEvent, Waitable};
/// use core::sync::atomic::{AtomicUsize, Ordering};
/// struct WaitFor5Ticks(IRQEvent, AtomicUsize);
/// impl Waitable for WaitFor5Ticks {
///     fn is_signaled(&self) -> bool {
///         self.1.compare_and_swap(0, 5, Ordering::SeqCst);
///         if self.0.is_signaled() {
///             if self.1.fetch_sub(1) == 0 {
///                 return true;
///             } else {
///                 return false;
///             }
///         } else {
///             return false;
///         }
///     }
///     fn register(&self) {
///         self.0.register()
///     }
/// }
/// ```
pub trait Waitable: Debug + Send + Sync {
    /// Checks whether the Waitable was signalled.
    ///
    /// If it returns false, the register function will be called again, in order
    /// to get notified of the next wakeup.
    ///
    /// This will likely require to change state - and yet it takes self by value.
    /// the reason for this is that it's possible for multiple threads, and
    /// potentially multiple CPUs, to wait on the same Waitable. Think of servers:
    /// you might want to wait for multiple threads for the arrival of a new socket.
    /// When this happens, **only a single thread should return true**. Make extra
