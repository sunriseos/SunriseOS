//! CPU local storage
//!
//! We want some statics to be cpu-local (e.g. [`CURRENT_THREAD`]). We could implement this fully
//! in software, by having an area of memory that is replicated for every cpu core, where
//! statics are indexes in this memory area, and provide getters and setters to access and modify
//! the cpu-local statics.
//!
//! However this is not ideal as it is not really optimized, and pretty tedious.
//!
//! Instead we use the very common concept of Thread Local Storage (TLS), and apply it to cpu cores
//! instead of threads, and let the compiler do all the hard work for us.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! In the kernel you declare a cpu-local using the [#\[thread_local\] attribute] :
//!
//! ```
//! #[thread_local]
//! static MY_CPU_LOCAL: core::cell::Cell<u8> = core::cell::Cell::new(42);
//! ```
//!
//! and access it as if it was a regular static, only that each cpu core will have its own view of
//! the static.
//!
//! The compiler is responsible for generating code that will access the right address, provided
//! we configured TLS correctly.
//!
//! ##### Early boot
//!
//! Note that you can't access a cpu-local static before [`init_cpu_locals`] is called, because
//! the cpu-local areas arent' initialized yet, and this will likely result to a cpu exception
//! being raised, or UB.
//!
//! This means you can't ever access cpu-locals in early boot. If your code might be called during
//! early boot, we advise you to use [`ARE_CPU_LOCALS_INITIALIZED_YET`] to know if you're allowed
//! to access your cpu-local static, and if not return an error of some kind.
//!
//! # Inner workings
//!
//! We implement the TLS according to conventions laid out by [Ulrich Drepper's paper on TLS] which
//! is followed by LLVM and most compilers.
//!
//! Since we're running on i386, we're following variant II.
//!
//! Each cpu core's `gs` segment points to a thread local memory area where cpu-locals statics live.
//! Cpu-local statics are simply accessed through an offset from `gs`.
//! Those regions can be found in [`CPU_LOCAL_REGIONS`].
//!
//! The linker is in charge of creating an ELF segment of type `PT_TLS` where an initialization image
//! for cpu local regions can be found, and is meant to be copy-pasted for every ~~thread we create~~
//! cpu core we have.
//!
//! ##### Segmentation
//!
//! Each core gets its own [GDT]. In each of these there is a `KTls` segment which points to this
//! core's cpu-local area, and which is meant to be loaded into `gs`.
//!
//! Because userspace might want to use Thread Local Storage too, and also needs `gs` to point to its
//! thread local area (see [`set_thread_area`]), we swap the segment `gs` points to everytime
//! we enter and leave the kernel in [`trap_gate_asm`], from `UTls_Elf` to `KTls` and back.
//!
//! TLS on x86 are really weird. It uses the variant II, where offsets must be *subtracted* from `gs`,
//! even though segmentation only supports *adding* offsets. The only way to make them work is to have
//! `gs` segment's limit be `0xffffffff`, effectively spanning the whole address space, and when
//! the cpu will add a "negative" (e.g. `0xfffffffc` for -4) offset, it will treat it as an unsigned
//! huge positive offset, which when added to `gs`'s base will "wrap around" the address space,
//! and effectively end up 4 bytes behind `gs`'s base.
//!
//! Illustration:
//!
//! ![cpu backflip](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sunriseos/SunriseOS/master/kernel/res/cpu_locals_segmentation_doc.gif)
//!
//! ##### dtv and `__tls_get_addr`
//!
//! We're the kernel, and we don't do dynamic loading (no loadable kernel modules).
//! Because of this, we know our TLS model will be static (either Initial Exec or Local Exec).
//! Those models always access thread-locals directly via `gs`, and always short-circuit the dtv.
//!
//! So we don't even bother allocating a dtv array at all. Neither do we define a `__tls_get_addr`
//! function.
