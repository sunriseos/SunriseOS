/// Performs the process switch, switching from currently running process A, to process B.
///
/// The process switch is composed of two parts :
///
/// * The "schedule out" part, where A takes care of saving its registers, prepares itself to be left,
///   and performs the switch by loading B's registers.
///   A is now stopped and waiting to be scheduled in again.
/// * The "schedule in" part, where B which was previously scheduled out by another process switch,
///   now restores the registers it had saved on the stack, finalises the switch,
///   and resumes its previous activity.
///
/// ### Schedule out:
///
/// The schedule-out code performs the following steps:
///
/// 1. change A's state from Running to Scheduled
/// 2. change B's state from Scheduled to Running
/// 3. switch to using B's memory space. KernelLand of A is copied to B at this point.
/// 4. save registers of A on its stack
/// 5. save special "hardware_context" registers of A in its ProcessStruct.
///    This is only the register containing the pointer to the top of the stack
///    where all other registers are saved.
/// 6. load B's special hardware_contexts registers.
///    This is where the process switch actually happens. Now we are running on B's stack,
///    and Program Counter was moved to B's schedule-in routine
///
/// ### Schedule in:
///
/// 1. restore the registers that it had saved on the stack
/// 2. return to what it was doing before
///
/// ### Switching to a fresh process:
///
/// In the special case where B is a newly born process, and it's its first time being scheduled (Owww, so cute),
/// it hasn't been scheduled out before, and doesn't have anything on the stack yet.
/// We choose to use the same schedule-in method for both cases, that means the schedule-in will
/// expect the new process to have a bunch of values on the stack that will be pop'ed into registers,
/// and finally ret' to a saved program counter on the stack.
/// This program counter can be used to control where the process will end-up on it's first schedule,
/// likely just a function that will jump straight to userspace.
///
/// The stack can be prepared for schedule-in by the function prepare_for_first_schedule().
///
/// # Return
///
/// Returns an Arc to the current ProcessSwitch after the switch, which was passed on during the switch.
///
/// # Panics
///
/// Panics if the locks protecting the ProcessStruct of current or B process cannot be obtained.
/// Panics if the locks protecting the MAIN_TASK TSS or DOUBLE_FAULT_TSS cannot be obtained.
///
/// # Safety
///
/// Interrupts definitely must be masked when calling this function
